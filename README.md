# Combinatorics-For-Programmers
A written tutorial for aspiring programmers

I wrote this with the hope of helping some self taught programmers learn more about the underlying thinking behind programming.
It has some examples and it helps explain the process behind some of the important details of code. I hope you take something away from it.
